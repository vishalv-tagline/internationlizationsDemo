            "home2":"The term “home” covers a large number of needs and requirements. A home requires different areas, including those for sleeping, cooking, eating and hygiene, in a single location. Home life is something quite ordinary in this context, but by no means unimportant. Life at home is one way people have of defining themselves. The place a person chooses to live identifies their preferences and constraints. The size, form and furnishings of a home, and the way it is occupied, influence the states of mind of the people in it. It is a place for retreat, but also a place for com-munication; for both introverted and extroverted situations. Fundamen-tally different sets of events may take place at the same time, and it is not always possible to combine the various interests and functions with-out making compromis.",
